By Marco Hutter, @javagl

This tutorial gives an introduction to glTF, the GL transmission format. It summarizes the most important features and application cases of glTF, and describes the structure of the files that are related to glTF. It explains how glTF assets may be read, processed, and used to display 3D graphics efficiently.

Some basic knowledge about JSON, the JavaScript Object Notation, is assumed. Additionally, a basic understanding of common graphics APIs, like OpenGL or WebGL, is required.
